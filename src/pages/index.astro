      <h3>cooking</h3>
      When I'm at home but not at my desk, i'm probably in the kitchen! I don't have
      much in terms of posts in that category <i>yet</i> though.
      <h3>photography</h3>
      I enjoy photography as well - at Purdue I did lots of work in photojournalism
      and sports photography, but these days I mostly just take pictures of my cooking
      and the great outdoors.
