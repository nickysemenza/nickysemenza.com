## Backyard Renovation beginings

After finishing the [kitchen renovation](/blog/kitchen-renovation) in <DatePill d="fall 2024" />, we turned our attention to the backyard in <DatePill d="spring 2025" />. But actually this project really began back in <DatePill d="2023" /> when we moved in.

Here's what it looked like before:

<GalleryView gallerySlug={'before'} />

### Palm Tree Removal

Our first task was to get rid of the giant 80ft palm tree that was both not the right vibe and also on its last legs.
It took the crew 2 whole days to cut it down, chop it up into pieces that would fit out through the garage and into their truck, and to grind the stump

### Misc Demlotion

After that, we didn't really have a plan yet but decided to start destroying some stuff.

### A break for the kitchen.

From <DatePill d="may 2024" /> to <DatePill d="september 2024" />, we focused on the kitchen renovation.
The only progress we made was while we had some hauling done for kitchen debris, I had them clean out the yard

### More deforestation

There were 3 eucalyptus trees that were taking up a lot of space, and dropping lots of branches. Did you know eucalyptus oil stops things from growing! There were no weeds under the tree.
In <DatePill d="Jan 2025" />, we had the eucalyptus trees cut down and removed, and the stumps ground.

## Planning and Project Overview

### Getting back to planning

In <DatePill d="early 2025" />, we started planning the backyard renovation. We started getting some samples for tiles and bricks, and looking at bulk materials for the hardscaping.

<GalleryView gallerySlug={'jan-feb-2025-planning'} />

I started working on some preliminary drawings finally. One big decision we made was to terrace the yard, since there was a 3 foot gradual rise from the front to the back.

<GalleryView gallerySlug={'jan-2025-plans'} />

One of the last big demo tasks left was to remove the old chain link fencing. The price was good and they did it in a day, so I didn't take this on myself.

### Grading

In <DatePill d="May 2025" />, The real work started. I got someone to come drive a mini excavator through the garage, and regrade the yard.

### Project Overview

The backyard project included:

- **demolition**: Removed old drip irrigation, smaller trees, and a brick/wood planter
- **structures**: Built cedar fence caps, light poles, firepit area, and custom hose hooks
- **irrigation**: New drip system for native beds, fruit trees, and planter boxes
- **electrical**: Outdoor wifi, ethernet switch, LED lights in cedar, heated chairs
- **hardscaping**: Base rock, landscape fabric, brick pavers, gravel areas, concrete stairs
- **planting**: Native plants, herbs, vegetables, fruit trees (rangpur lime, plum)

### Demolition & Prep

First we cleared out the old landscape - removing the existing drip irrigation system, some smaller trees, and an old brick and wood planter. Got a soil test to understand what amendments we'd need.

<GalleryView gallerySlug={'backyard_2025_demo'} />

Tasks completed:

- Soil test
- Remove smaller trees, drip irrigation, pipes
- Remove brick and wood planter
- Clean garage (multiple times)
- Sell compactor

### Structures & Woodwork

With the yard cleared, we built the structural elements that would define the space. This included cedar planks for the fence cap, custom light poles, and a firepit area.

<GalleryView gallerySlug={'backyard_2025_structures'} />

The hose hook was a fun metalworking project - welded from steel, painted, and mounted to the fence.

### Irrigation

The irrigation system was designed with drip lines for the native plant beds, fruit trees, and raised planter boxes. Had to fix a leaking water pipe along the way.

Tasks completed:

- Drip in native beds
- Drip emitters in native beds
- Irrigation for fruit trees
- Install drip tubing into planter boxes
- Install drip heads in remaining beds

- Fill in sprinkler trenches, grade upper

### Electrical & Tech

One of my favorite parts - adding outdoor technology infrastructure. This included outdoor wifi and ethernet for streaming/working outside, LED lights embedded in the cedar fence cap, dimmers for the floodlights, and heated outdoor chairs.

Tasks completed:

- Finalize wiring path
- Install outdoor wifi
- Install outdoor ethernet switch
- Install lights in cedar
- Warm bulbs for outdoor floodlights

### Hardscaping

The biggest transformation came from the hardscaping. We laid base rock, compacted it, installed landscape fabric, and then set brick pavers across 5 pallets worth. The concrete stairs were poured to connect the upper and lower areas.
